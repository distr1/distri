# This is the shortest and fastest way to build an empty package:
dep: "bash"
build_step: {
  argv: "/bin/sh"
  argv: "-c"
  argv: ""
}

# The following packages will be installed on ALL distri cloud machines:
runtime_dep: "base-full"
runtime_dep: "haveged"  # for gathering entropy on e.g. Google Cloud
