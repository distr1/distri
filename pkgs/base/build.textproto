# This is the shortest and fastest way to build an empty package:
dep: "bash"
build_step: {
  argv: "/bin/sh"
  argv: "-c"
  argv: ""
}

# The following packages will be installed on ALL distri machines:
runtime_dep: "bash"  # shell, to install more packages, and run wrapper scripts
runtime_dep: "coreutils"  # for minimal introspection (pulled in by distri1 anyway)
runtime_dep: "distri1"

# TODO: split out into base-boot once pack supports images that don’t need
# booting (e.g. docker)
runtime_dep: "systemd"  # for booting
runtime_dep: "dbus"  # for e.g. systemd’s timedatectl
runtime_dep: "grub2"  # for BIOS boot
runtime_dep: "grub2-efi"  # for UEFI boot

# For creating an initramfs:
runtime_dep: "dracut"
runtime_dep: "linux"
runtime_dep: "linux-firmware"
runtime_dep: "cryptsetup"  # for pack -encrypt

# TODO: remove once pack no longer unconditionally enables units:
runtime_dep: "containerd"
runtime_dep: "docker-engine"
runtime_dep: "openssh"
runtime_dep: "haveged"
